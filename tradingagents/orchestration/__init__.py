"""Orchestration: the cycle runner that ties the whole alpha together.

Flow (the funnel + trigger engine of the wiki):

    Trigger Engine  ->  priority queue  ->  analyze (LLM graph)  ->  cost gate  ->  execute

The ``analyze`` step is a pluggable hook: Luca's LangGraph implements the
``Analyzer`` signature; until then a ``hold_analyzer`` stub keeps the runner
fully testable without any LLM.
