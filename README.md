A research project exploring how to run a **portfolio-managing AI fund** the way a real desk works: a team of specialist analyst agents that gather their own data, debate a thesis, and hand it to a deterministic risk gate and trade function. The LLMs do the *reasoning*; everything quantitative — position sizing, price levels, guardrails, execution, exits — is deterministic, tested Python.

> ⚠️ Educational / research project. **Paper trading only**, not financial advice. The codebase mirrors a separate design wiki (`architettura.canvas`): states, nodes and edges follow the spec, not an inherited framework.

## ✨ What this project demonstrates

- **Multi-agent orchestration** with LangGraph — a real graph of agents (2 desks → Portfolio Manager → Risk Analyst) with a "when in doubt, ask" loop.
- **Autonomous tool-calling** — each agent calls its own tools (the *Extractors set*), fetches real-time-first data and writes it through to the DB.
- **Per-agent memory** — every agent keeps a structured context window tailored to its task, accumulating across the analysis.
- **Deterministic risk core** — ATR-based entry/stop/target, risk-based sizing with portfolio heat, an institutional "Statute" (R:R, 10% cash reserve, VaR, sector caps), exit management and rating-based disinvestment.
- **DB-first data layer** — time-series + documents in one engine (SQLite → PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB), double-dated to prevent look-ahead bias.
- **Swappable broker adapter**, idempotent orders, crash reconciliation.
- **A deterministic backtester** to validate the thresholds.
- **216 offline tests** — no network, no keys: fake LLM + fake fetchers as the oracle that the code matches the design.

## 🧠 How it works

The only non-deterministic part is the **brain** (the LLM agents). They fill the investment thesis; the rest is tested Python.

## 🛠️ Tech stack

Python 3.13 · LangGraph / LangChain · OpenRouter · SQLAlchemy 2 (SQLite / PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB) · Pydantic · pytest · `uv`.

## 🚀 Quick start

A single **uv-managed environment** (`.venv`) holds everything (runtime + dev
tools); always use `uv`.

```bash
uv sync                                   # provisions .venv with all deps + dev

# configure .env (see .env.example) — at minimum OPENROUTER_API_KEY
# optional: FRED_API_KEY (macro), ALPACA_* or a running TWS/IB Gateway (broker)

# run the whole system in the BACKGROUND (one command), then stop it
uv run python -m tradingagents.cli start     # detached; prints a confirmation
uv run python -m tradingagents.cli status
uv run python -m tradingagents.cli stop

# or run in the foreground:
uv run python -m tradingagents.cli run            # autonomous: works the watchlist
uv run python -m tradingagents.cli run AAPL MSFT  # explicit override
uv run python -m tradingagents.cli run --loop 3600
```

With no symbols the system is fully autonomous: it learns the broker's investable
universe, seeds a dynamic watchlist (S&P 500 ∩ tradable), and decides what to
analyse from its own state. Background logs + PID live in `~/.tradingagents/`.

Broker is chosen in `config.toml` (`[broker] provider = paper | alpaca | ibkr`);
IBKR uses the TWS API via `ib_async` and needs a running TWS/IB Gateway.

## ⚙️ Configuration

One global file controls **every** tunable parameter — **`config.toml`** (repo
root): LLM models, broker (paper/live), risk & sizing, the Statute guardrails,
screening, the autonomous cycle, data lookback and costs. It is the single
source of truth; the **`.env` holds only secrets** (API keys + DB connection).
Anything omitted keeps its default (`tradingagents/config.py`).

```toml
[llm]
provider   = "openrouter"
deep_model = "openrouter/owl-alpha"   # free, tool-calling
[broker]
provider = "paper"       # "paper" (simulator) | "alpaca"
mode     = "paper"       # "paper" | "live"  (alpaca)
[risk]
base_risk_pct = 0.01     # risk budget per trade (× conviction)
k_stop = 2.0             # stop distance in ATR
[charter]
cash_reserve_pct = 0.10  # strategic cash reserve
max_sector_pct = 0.30
[cycle]
interval_seconds = 3600  # autonomous loop period
```

## ✅ Testing

```bash
uv run python -m pytest -m "not integration"   # fast, offline, deterministic
uv run python -m pytest -m integration         # network: yfinance · Alpaca · IBKR · LLM
```

The offline suite needs no network and no API keys — the brain runs against a fake LLM and the vendors against fake fetchers, so the tests are a true oracle for the design.

## 🧭 Design philosophy

- **LLMs reason, code computes.** Numbers come from tools and deterministic functions, never from the model's head.
- **Real-time first, write-through.** Live data is fetched fresh and persisted; the DB stays the single source of truth.
- **Few strong agents, not many weak ones.** Specialised desks with powerful tools, minimal context rot.
- **Alpha-first / incremental.** Get a running slice, then deepen.

## 🛣️ Roadmap

- **Read-only dashboard** (Streamlit, SFC-fund style) to observe the running
  daemon: portfolio, NAV, watchlist/universe, decisions and trades, alpha vs
  benchmark, logs — observe, never control.
- **Observability & evaluation**: LangSmith + LangGraph Studio for graph tracing, agent debugging and prompt evaluation.
- **Inter-task agent memory** (learn from past cases) + systematic DB dedup.
- **Live execution**: IBKR adapter, real options chain, service wrapper (24/7, market-hours scheduling, crash recovery).
- **Parameter tuning** in backtest.
